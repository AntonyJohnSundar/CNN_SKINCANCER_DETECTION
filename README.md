## General Information

### Problem Statement
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.


### Given Data 

Dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging   Collaboration (ISIC)


## Technologies Used

Python Libraries:

- pandas
- tensorflow
- pathlib
- matplotlib.pyplot
- augumentor


## Conclusions

- We have built the basic model using CNN in tensorflow and learnt the model is overfitting and had class imbalance

- We have used Dropouts and Data Augumention to tackle overfitting and class imbalance

- We have achieved a decent model with approx 80% of accuracy
